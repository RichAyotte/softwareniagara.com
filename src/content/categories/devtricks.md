DevTricks is a staple of the Niagara tech scene. Join us for an evening of technology presentations. Presenters cover a variety of topics, including programming languages, libraries, frameworks, testing, quality control, architecture, topics in computer science, and more.

This event is targeted at students, hobbyists, and professional developers but everyone is welcome.
